# NOTE SETTINGS
#
# Defines the default options used when generating new notes.
[note]

# Language used when writing notes.
# This is used to generate slugs or with date formats.
#language = "en"

# The default title used for new note, if no `--title` flag is provided.
#default-title = "Untitled"

# Template used to generate a note's filename, without extension.

# The file extension used for the notes.

# Configure random ID generation.

# The charset used for random IDs. You can use:
#   * letters: only letters from a to z.
#   * numbers: 0 to 9
#   * alphanum: letters + numbers
#   * hex: hexadecimal, from a to f and 0 to 9
#   * custom string: will use any character from the provided value

# EXTRA VARIABLES
#
# A dictionary of variables you can use for any custom values when generating

# GROUP OVERRIDES
#
# You can override global settings from [note] and [extra] for a particular
# group of notes by declaring a [group."<name>"] section.
#
# Specify the list of directories which will automatically belong to the group
# with the optional `paths` property.
#
# Omitting `paths` is equivalent to providing a single path equal to the name of
# the group. This can be useful to quickly declare a group by the name of the
# directory it applies to.

# MARKDOWN SETTINGS
[format.markdown]

# Format used to generate links between notes.
# Either "wiki", "markdown" or a custom template. Default is "markdown".

# Indicates whether a link's path will be percent-encoded.
# Defaults to true for "markdown" format and false for "wiki" format.

# Indicates whether a link's path file extension will be removed.
# Defaults to true.

# Enable support for #hashtags.

# EXTERNAL TOOLS
[tool]

# Default editor used to open notes. When not set, the EDITOR or VISUAL
# environment variables are used.

# Pager used to scroll through long output. If you want to disable paging
# altogether, set it to an empty string "".

# Report titles of wiki-links as hints.
#wiki-title = "hint"

[lsp.completion]
# Customize the completion pop-up of your LSP client.

# Show the note title in the completion pop-up, or fallback on its path if empty.

# Filter out the completion pop-up using the note title or its path.

# NAMED FILTERS
#
#    A named filter is a set of note filtering options used frequently together.
#
[filter]

# Matches the notes created the last two weeks. For example:
#    $ zk list recents --limit 15
#    $ zk edit recents --interactive
#recents = "--sort created- --created-after 'last two weeks'"


# COMMAND ALIASES
#
#   Aliases are user commands called with `zk <alias> [<flags>] [<args>]`.
#
#   The alias will be executed with `$SHELL -c`, please refer to your shell's
#   man page to see the available syntax. In most shells:
#     * $@ can be used to expand all the provided flags and arguments
#     * you can pipe commands together with the usual | character
#
[alias]
# Here are a few aliases to get you started.

# Shortcut to a command.
#ls = "zk list $@"

# Default flags for an existing command.
#list = "zk list --quiet $@"

# Edit the last modified note.
#editlast = "zk edit --limit 1 --sort modified- $@"

# Edit the notes selected interactively among the notes created the last two weeks.
# This alias doesn't take any argument, so we don't use $@.
#recent = "zk edit --sort created- --created-after 'last two weeks' --interactive"

# Print paths separated with colons for the notes found with the given
# arguments. This can be useful to expand a complex search query into a flag
# taking only paths. For example:
#   zk list --link-to "`zk path -m potatoe`"
#path = "zk list --quiet --format {{path}} --delimiter , $@"

# Show a random note.
#lucky = "zk list --quiet --format full --sort random --limit 1"

# Returns the Git history for the notes found with the given arguments.
# Note the use of a pipe and the location of $@.
#hist = "zk list --format path --delimiter0 --quiet $@ | xargs -t -0 git log --patch --"

# Edit this configuration file.
#conf = '$EDITOR "$ZK_NOTEBOOK_DIR/.zk/config.toml"'
