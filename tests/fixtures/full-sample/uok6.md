# Stick to your portfolio strategy

Choose a portfolio strategy, such as the [Couch potato investment strategy](hdi6), and stick to it.

Second-guessing and tweaking make your portfolio under perform. Ignore your emotions when the market fluctuates, this details most investors. Instead, keep steady and trust that [compound interests make you rich](smdc). A good way to do that is to look at your investments performance only once a year.

## The less you think about the market, the more money you make

Don't listen to investment news, stock predictions or economic forecasts.

Don't tweak your investments to adjust to world events, there's not always a logical connection between world events and the markets performance, because the [financial markets are random](fa2k).
