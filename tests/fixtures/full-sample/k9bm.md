# How to choose a broker?

A broker will trade your portfolio for you on the markets.

You should choose a broker that is located in a country where the government is stable and where banking regulations are solid.

Don't trade more than once a month, since brokers charge commissions when you trade.

On-going fees as percentage of a portfolio's assets are the real killer ([Investment business is a scam](4yib)) because [compound interests make you rich](smdc). However, commission fees on trading are okay.

It might be worth choosing a broker in your country, for easier tax filling.
