# Buy low, sell high

It's better to invest when the prices are low, because it will usually go up on the long term, despite the fact that [financial markets are random](fa2k).

Don't wait until you think the stocks are at their lowest ([speculation](pywo)), instead buy some when the prices are dropping, and buy more every month if the prices continue to drop.

Investing a constant amount of money regularly (e.g. monthly) is a simple way to make sure you buy less stocks when the prices are high, and more when they are low. [Compound interests will work for you over time](smdc).
