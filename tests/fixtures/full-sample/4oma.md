# Message passing

*   A popular approach for safe concurrency is to use *message passing* instead of shared state.
*   Channels are an example of a message passing implementation.
*   The Go language is advocating for this approach with their slogan: "[Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating](ref/7fto)".
