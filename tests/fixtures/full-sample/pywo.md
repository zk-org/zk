# Don't speculate

You have more to loose by doing market timing (jumping in and out of the stocks market). Remember, [the less you think about the market, the more money you make](uok6).

For example, from 1982 to 2005, the market averaged 10.6 percent annually, but if you missed the 10 best trading days, your return would drop to 8.1 percent, or 1.8 percent for the 50 best trading days.

Take your money out of the stock market for a day, a week or a month and you could miss the best trading days of the decade, nobody can predict those because [financial markets are random](fa2k).
