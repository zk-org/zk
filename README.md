## News: We Are In Maintenance Mode


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> As of January 2nd, the original brain behind zk, [Mickaël
> Menu](https://github.com/mickael-menu), made the difficult decision to retire
> from zk and the suite of programs supporting it. He put out a [call for
> maintainers](https://github.com/zk-org/zk/discussions/371), which has
> garnerned enough response to enable the project to continue! So zk is
> definitely still here for you.
>
> During this transition phase, we are placing the project into a maintenance
> mode, which means we are going to address existing issues and any teething
> problems with transferring the code bases to the new
> [zk-org](https://github.com/zk-org) organisation, which is where you can now
> find all the related projects. It also gives us new maintainers the space to
> get up to speed with the code base, which will help us address new issues and
> feature requests when they come.
>
> So for now, feel free to lodge new issues, but please withold on feature
> requests until we are out of maintenance mode. This will help keep our issues
> boards concise and pr's easier to manage.
>
> The [call to maintainers](https://github.com/zk-org/zk/discussions/371) is
> still open. Please comment there if you feel commited enough to come onboard!
> PR's, ideas, discussions and conversations are still and always will be
> warmly welcomed, with or without 'maintainer' status ❤️
