# Notebook configuration

The `[notebook]` section from the [configuration file](config.md) is used to set
the default notebook directory. If the path starts with `~` it will be replaced
with the user home directory (`$HOME`). This property also supports environment
variables.

```toml
[notebook]
dir = "~/notebook" # same as "$HOME/notebook"
```

The following properties are customizable:

- `dir` (string)
  - Path of the default notebook.
  - Only available in the global config file (`~/.config/zk/config.toml`).
