# A future-proof notebook

`zk` is designed to be future-proof and rely on simple
[plain text formats](../notes/note-format.md) such as Markdown.

The shape of your [notebook](../notes/notebook.md) is entirely up to you, making
`zk` flexible enough to be used in a variety of contexts. However, `zk` shines
in a Zettelkasten-style notebook with many small interlinked notes.
