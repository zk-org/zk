# ZK Docs

The docs in `source` are also a `zk` notebook ðŸ˜‰

Write docs in your editor, as you know best; with `zk`!

## Local Setup

- [install Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)
- install Furo theme: `pip install furo`

This will build the static html site in `build`.

Then open `build/index.html` in your browser.
